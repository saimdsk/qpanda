Considerations that need to be made.

1. Do I need the bootstrap javascript script?
The only reason I have included it is because of the bootstrap alerts (I'm using alerts to display error messages). You
need javascript to close the alert. However I can just include that functionality in qpanda.js instead of using the full
bootstrap.js. As I type this, I realise that the answer is pretty clear. I should just include the functionality in
qpanda.js.
