TODO Redirect to the appropriate url.
i.e. If a user logs out from askedquestion we should log them out and then return to that same question. Same for if
they login from askedquesiton. For our views that do work but do not display anything, we should redirect the user to
the page that they called. This can be done by passing a next url parameter. Explained here:

TODO Change pk of how answers work
TODO Only display 10 most recent answers and AJAX on next page
TODO Add passwords for protected questions
TODO Allow questions that expire
TODO Allow voting on answers
TODO Allow thread owner to delete answers
TODO Allow editing of answers (by answerer not threadowner, threadowner can only delete)

I wrote a blogpost describing how to localise time client side instead of doing it server side here:

So I did do some work, but didn't exactly further the project. I want to keep the commit streak going though!
