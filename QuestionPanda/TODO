SUPER IMPORTANT

LESS IMPORTANT (but still significant)
TODO Choose anonymous if logged in
Allow a user to choose whether their question will be asked anonymously or attached to their username if they are logged
in.
TODO Add passwords for protected questions
TODO Allow questions that expire
TODO Allow voting on answers
Adding this feature will require a little more work. We would have to rewrite the views and templates to allow the
ordering of answers based on both votes and answers.

TODO Allow thread owner to delete answers
TODO Allow editing of answers (by answerer not threadowner, threadowner can only delete)

OPTIONAL
TODO Change pk of how answers work

I wrote a blogpost describing how to localise time client side instead of doing it server side here:

So I did do some work, but didn't exactly further the project. I want to keep the commit streak going though!
