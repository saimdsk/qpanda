SUPER IMPORTANT

LESS IMPORTANT (but still significant)
TODO Stop loading answers when all answers have been displayed.
If the user is viewing the last 10 answers, the button to load more answers still appears. We're not going to display a
grey button. We don't need a button at all if all answers have been displayed.

TODO Add login button when the user accidentally clicks register
TODO Add passwords for protected questions
TODO Allow questions that expire
TODO Allow voting on answers
TODO Allow thread owner to delete answers
TODO Allow editing of answers (by answerer not threadowner, threadowner can only delete)

OPTIONAL
TODO Change pk of how answers work

So I did do some work, but didn't exactly further the project. I want to keep the commit streak going though!
